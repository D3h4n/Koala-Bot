# Koala Bot

## <u>**About**</u>

Multipurpose discord bot with tons of commands.

The goal of this bot is to create weirder and more challenging
commands to practice problem solving with limited tools.

## <u>**Todo**</u>
  - [ ] Move registering and deregistering commands to separate programs
  - [ ] Figure out command perms (permissions don't apply to commands for some reason)
  - [ ] Figure out reactions (reactions are not collected from messages)
